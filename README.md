# Financial-Ratios-API
Tradefeeds is a provider of real-time REST JSON API for financial ratios data. Our <a href=""> Financial Ratios Database</a> contains 76 types of financial ratios used frequently by analysts and investors when evaluating companies. The data is organized according to the six main groups of financial ratios: liquidity ratios, solvency ratios (also known as leverage ratios), turnover ratios (also known as leverage ratios), profitability ratios and market value measures, as well as other uncategorized ratios. We use mathematical formulas to calculate the financial ratios in Tradefeeds API database. The system uses the financial information disclosed in the annual or quarterly reports of companies during a particular year or a quarter. Customers should select a company, a financial reporting period and formulas for which they want to obtain data on financial ratios.

Our customers are diverse starting from developers, investors, traders, creditors to universities and research centes. Developers would build mobile and web applications with the help of financial ratios data API. Compared to them, financial analysts, investors, traders, universities and research centers use the API for financial ratios to perform company valuation.
